# CLAUDE.md

Project-wide conventions for Claude Code (and humans). Treat this file as authoritative when generating or reviewing code in this repo. The product spec lives in `Plan.md`; this file is about **how we build it**.

## 1. What this repo is

TikFlow is a multi-tenant SaaS for ISPs that automates MikroTik-based subscriber management and billing. See `Plan.md` for product context, architecture, schema, and 16-phase roadmap.

Current phase: **Phase 0 — Foundation, Design System, Security Baseline**.

## 5. How to add a new feature

Every feature goes through this pipeline. Skipping a step is a review-blocker.

1. **DB migration** — add/alter tables in `packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma`. Every new table gets `tenant_id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `deleted_at`, **and an RLS policy** in the same migration.
2. **Prisma model regen** — `pnpm db:generate`.
3. **Zod contract** — define request/response schemas in `packages/contracts`. They are the single source of truth for both server validation and client types.
4. **tRPC procedure or REST route** — in `apps/api`. Always inside a tenant-scoped middleware (`SET LOCAL app.current_tenant`). Always rate-limited.
5. **React Query hook** — in `apps/web/lib/hooks` (auto-typed via tRPC).
6. **UI** — page or component using `@tikflow/ui` primitives only (no raw shadcn imports in feature code).
7. **i18n** — every user-visible string goes in `packages/i18n/en.json` from day 1. No hard-coded strings — pseudo-locale CI gate will fail.
8. **Tests** — unit (Vitest) for pure logic, integration (testcontainers) for DB code, Playwright e2e for user flows. **RLS test** mandatory for every new tenant-scoped table.
9. **Docs** — update `CLAUDE.md` if conventions changed; update `docs/` runbook if operational behavior changed.

---

## 6. Forbidden patterns

These will fail review (and most will fail CI):

- `any`, `as any`, `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-expect-error` without an inline justification comment explaining why.
- Raw SQL outside `packages/db`. Inside `packages/db` use Prisma's `Prisma.sql` tagged template — never string concatenation.
- `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. Sanitize via DOMPurify if absolutely required and document why.
- `new Date()` math for billing/scheduling. Use `date-fns-tz` with the tenant's timezone.
- Hard-coded user-visible strings. Use `next-intl` translations.
- Logging PII. Pino's `redact` paths cover `password`, `token`, `nid`, `pppoeSecret`, etc. — extend the list, don't bypass it.
- Direct `process.env` reads outside a single `env.ts` per app (validated by Zod at boot).
- Cross-tenant queries that don't include `tenantId`. The Prisma extension enforces this; don't disable it.
- Committing secrets, `.env`, private keys, or anything not in `.env.example`.
- Adding a new top-level dependency without justifying in the PR description.

---

## 7. Tenant safety rule (the one that matters most)

Every query that touches tenant data must:

1. Run inside the `tenantContext` middleware, which opens a transaction and runs `SET LOCAL app.current_tenant = $tenantId`.
2. Use the Prisma client extension that auto-injects `where: { tenantId }`.
3. Be covered by an **RLS test** that:
   - Inserts data as Tenant A.
   - Switches the session to Tenant B.
   - Asserts Tenant B sees zero rows even with a forged `where: { tenantId: <A> }`.

If you add a tenant-scoped table without an RLS policy, the migration check in CI will fail.

---

## 8. PR conventions

- One logical change per PR. Target diff: ≤ 400 lines (excluding lockfiles, generated files, test fixtures).
- Conventional Commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `perf:`.
- Commit body explains **why**, not what — the diff already shows the what.
- A PR isn't done until: types ✅, tests ✅, lint ✅, prettier ✅, axe (a11y) ✅, audit ✅, deployed to staging.
- For phase-scoped PRs, prefix with phase: `feat(p0): bootstrap monorepo`.

---

## 9. Definition of Done (per PR)

- [ ] No new `any` / `@ts-ignore` (or justified inline)
- [ ] Tests added or updated; all green locally + CI
- [ ] Strings extracted to `en` translation bundle
- [ ] `axe-core` passes in Playwright (no serious/critical)
- [ ] No new high/critical from `pnpm audit`
- [ ] No secrets in diff
- [ ] `CLAUDE.md` or relevant `docs/` updated if conventions changed
- [ ] Migrations include RLS policy + RLS test (if new tenant-scoped table)
- [ ] Deployed to staging and smoke-tested
